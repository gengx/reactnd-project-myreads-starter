# MyReads

## Project Overview:

This application was built for one of the course projects of the Udacity React Nanodegree Program that I took in 2017-2018. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the capability to build React application.

## How to Install and Run the App
The project uses Node.js. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, you can run the following command under the project root directory:
```
npm install
```
This will get all of the dependencies installed. Then you can launch the app using:
```
npm start
```

A new browser window should automatically open and load the app.  If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser


## How to Use the App
The app has two pages, a "My Reads" page and a book search page:
* The "My Reads" page shows all the books of the user and are categorized into 3 shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read
* Users can change the category of the books by clicking on the green button and pick a category from it.

* To add new books, click on the green + button at the bottom of the page.It will navigate to the "search" page.
* Users can enter keywords to search books. Up to 20 items will be returned. A collection of the search terms are listed at the end of this document.
* Once users find the bookds they want to read, they can click on the green button on the book and move it to one of their shelved.
* Users can go back to the "library" page by clicking on the arrow on the top of the page.
* Once users are back to the page, they should see the newly added books show up in the correct shelf.
